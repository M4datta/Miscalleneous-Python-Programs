Alarm Clock

With this project in Python, we have successfully made the Alarm Clock. We used the popular GUI library for rendering graphics on a display window. We learned how to extract the current time from the computer and to use it for manipulation. This way we can set an alarm in the computer interface using python programming which rings with the default machine sound for Windows.

Calculator

 We have successfully designed a python calculator with tkinter. This means that we have a better understanding of the way tkinter is used to build GUI applications.
